Intro

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. I've built it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
I have used Figma in order to get all of the material to complete this project. There were roughly 7 sections of which I used the Grid feature for two of them. I also used Flexboxes in areas were it was appropriate. In order to create a responsive design, I have used Media Queries to match the Figma design that was given at 1280px, 768px, and 320px.
